This is the site for my personal project.
Yes, I am writing all of the html/css and eventually will write all of the javascript which will be implemented.

The background on the website is only a place holder img currently and I do not take any credit for this photo being taken.
However, The background will be updated with my own picture which I am currently waiting for the right time of the year to turn.

If you have any questions or conerns please feel free to contact me directly here on GitHub.

Thanks
Cody
